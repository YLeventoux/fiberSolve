this code calcul the fundamental mode of a given step index optical fiber
by solving the bessel function for the fiber (with dichotomie)
it give the waist, neff, Aeff

the waist is calculated either with gaussian aproximation or with patermann 2

the Aeff is calculated either with gaussian approximation or with the field integral formula

it has been done to be more precise than the marcus formula that doesn't work well
